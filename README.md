# Learn Terraform

## Introduction (30 min.) 

[HashiCorp on Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/):

> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files

Let's break that down:

- Open-source: You can view the [code](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform). There is an [enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html) and [cloud offering](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html) too.
- Infrastructure as code: You can describe in [plain text](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-demo/blob/master/do.tf) what infrastructure you need.
- CLI workflow: From a Linux machines, you can use the `terraform` binary.
- Cloud services: Terraform describes "resources", which can be: machines, ip-addresses, loadbalancers, etc.
- declarative configuration: You describe the infrastructure, Terraform will build (or destroy) it.
