This is a bigger chapter, because the Terraform syntax must be explained at first.

There are three cloud providers to learn this material on:

- [AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started).
- [Azure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/azure-get-started).
- [GCP](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/gcp-get-started).

You'll likely have questions, don't hesitate to ask them.
